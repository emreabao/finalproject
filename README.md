#topic = We are thinking about a DBMS using PostgreSQL with regards to the limitations that has been posted to the HUZEM website.With our friends we are planning to build a Database about Hacettepe University using either B-Trees or a location based DBMS that covers real-life persons such as academicians,deans,rector and some of the students that are actually a member of Hacettepe University.Also,to put more effort we are thinking about putting some restrictions such as a dean of a faculty can not be elected for a 2nd term etc.
